Disadvantages:

Complexity: C++ can be complex and challenging to learn, especially for beginners. Its extensive feature set and low-level capabilities can lead to more error-prone code.

Memory Management: Manual memory management in C++ can lead to memory leaks and other memory-related errors if not done correctly.

Verbose Syntax: C++ code can be verbose compared to some modern languages, which may slow down development.

Lack of Garbage Collection: C++ does not have built-in garbage collection, so developers must manage memory explicitly, which can be error-prone.

Compatibility Issues: Different compilers and platforms may have subtle incompatibilities in C++ code, requiring additional effort to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

Slower Development: Due to its complexity and need for careful memory management, development in C++ can be slower compared to higher-level languages.
